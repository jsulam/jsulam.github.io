  I am the **William R. Brody Faculty Scholar** and an **Assistant Professor** in [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, with secondary appointments in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) and [Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/). I am also a core member of [MINDS](https://www.minds.jhu.edu), [CIS](https://cis.jhu.edu), the [Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute](https://kavlijhu.org), and the [Data Science and AI Institute](https://ai.jhu.edu).
    
  My research bridges computer science, applied mathematics, and biomedical sciences. I develop **theory-grounded and interpretable machine learning methods** with applications in biomedical imaging, cancer prognosis, and protein modeling.
    
  I received my PhD in Computer Science from Technion (2018, advised by [Miki Elad](https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il)) and my Bioengineering degree from UNER (Argentina, 2013). I am a recipient of the **NSF CAREER Award** and the *Best Graduates* award from the Argentinean National Academy of Engineering.
