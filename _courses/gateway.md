  This course introduces fundamental data science concepts and techniques. It is intended for all who plan work on data driven projects, and will serve as a prerequisite for advanced courses in data science and machine learning. Topics covered include linear and nonlinear regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Students deploy Python packages on data sets and apply data science methods on engineering and science problems. Course homework involves significant programming. Attendance and participation in class sessions are expected.
