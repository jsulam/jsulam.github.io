  This work develops a data-driven method to automatically identify patterns of cell interactions in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment. These patterns reveal patient subgroups with different outcomes, enabling discovery of new prognostic biomarkers. While demonstrated in breast cancer, the approach is broadly applicable to other diseases.
