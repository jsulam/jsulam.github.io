  <h2 class="h4">Class Description</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    This upper-level undergraduate / lower-level graduate class focuses on fundamental concepts, learning paradigms, and problems in modern data science. We emphasize precise problem formulations, data models, and algorithms across supervised and unsupervised learning, plus modern applications.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-0">
    <strong>Who is this for?</strong> Students with prior coursework in statistics, linear algebra, programming, and an intro to data science—ideal for undergrads specializing in data science or new grad students entering the area.

  <p>
    The class combines lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions. Lectures are once a week, 2.5 hrs (with a break). TA session once a week complements the topics covered in the lectures and facilitates weekly (mandatory) quizzes. A small number of coding exercises are due through the first part of the semester, and a sizeable, research-like project (in small groups) is due at the of the semester.
